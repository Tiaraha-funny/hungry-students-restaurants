# hungry-students-restaurants

In this project, I worked on Vannilla Javascript. It offers the users to check the food that they like. They can add their food by clicking the add buttons. They can see their amount of their choosen food in the other side of the list and it is totaled in the button of the list. Then they can comfirm their food and wait till it is ready.
